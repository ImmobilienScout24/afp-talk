* IAM Users
* Static Credentials

==== Outline ====

\tableofcontents[currentsection]

==== afp-core ====

* ''Custom Federation Broker''
* Different providers
** AD group provider (humans)
** IP provider       (machines)
* A webapplication
* One of the few places left that ''does'' have static credentials

==== Connect AD --> AWS (Humans) ====

* Special groups in AD: @aws-accout-role@
* AD users are members of such groups
* E.g. @aws\_redecorator\_read-only@
* --> role: @read-only@ in accout @redecorator@
* (Yes it is configurable)
